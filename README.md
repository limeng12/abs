## Analysis of cryptic splice sites.

This repository includes intermediate results and data for this work. 

The result, source code and data for each organism/cell line are stored seperatelly in each folder. 

### Source code
 `code` stores source codes.

### Cryptic splice sites, cryptic exons and cryptic junctions
 `star_target_only_jc` stores cryptic junction.

 `star_target_only_jc_5ss` stores cryptic 5' splice sites.

 `star_target_only_jc_3ss` stores cryptic 3' splice sites.

 `exon_mer_target_only` stores cryptic exons.

 `exon_mer_target_only_5ss` stores cryptic exons' 5' splice sites.

### Motifs
 `star_abs3_motif` stores the motifs of cryptic splice 3' splice sites.

 `star_abs5_motif` stores the motifs of cryptic splice 5' splice sites.

 `star_abs3_motif_canonical` stores the motifs of cryptic splice 3' splice sites near canonical splice sites.

 `star_abs5_motif_canonical` stores the motifs of cryptic splice 5' splice sites near canonical splice sites.

 `star_abs3_motif_exon` stores the motifs of cryptic splice 3' splice sites in exon regions.

 `star_abs5_motif_exon` stores the motifs of cryptic splice 5' splice sites in exon regions.

 `star_abs3_motif_deep_intron` stores the motifs of cryptic splice 3' splice sites in deep introns.

 `star_abs5_motif_deep_intron` stores the motifs of cryptic splice 5' splice sites in deep introns.


### Metaprofiles to show cryptic splice sites' postion 
The `pdf` file in each cell line's directory
The meta-profiles of cryptic sites in K562, “3_” indicates cryptic 3' splice sites, while “5_” indicates cryptic 5' splice sites. Three panels in each figure: the first panel is the metaprofile of 5' splice sites, where 0 is the 5' splice site position; the second panel is the metaprofile of 3' splice sites, where 0 is the 3' splice site position; the third panel is around the brand point, where 0 is the branch point position.
